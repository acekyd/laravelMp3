# LaravelMP3

> Laravel Package to help you work with mp3 files easily. Simple yet powerful. Built on the getID3

## Install

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.5+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.3+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require acekyd/laravelmp3
```

Another alternative is to simply add the following line to the require block of your `composer.json` file.

```
"acekyd/laravelmp3": "1.*"
```

Then run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.


### Laravel 5.5+:
Just install the package via composer and laravel auto-discovers the pagkage. You're good to go!

If you're running a lower version of laravel or you don't use auto-discovery,

Add this to your providers array in `config/app.php`

```php

// Laravel 5.2: config/app.php

'providers' => [
    ...
    Acekyd\LaravelMP3\LaravelMP3ServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];
```

This package also comes with a facade

```php

// Laravel 5: config/app.php

'aliases' => [
    ...
    'LaravelMP3' => Acekyd\LaravelMP3\LaravelMP3Facade::class,
    ...
]
```

## Usage

Laravel MP3 requires you to pass only one argument which is the filepath. Can be done during or after upload.
Use it in your controllers to get the data you might need.

Add it to your controller if needed
``` php
	use LaravelMP3;

``` php
	$file = $request->file('music');
